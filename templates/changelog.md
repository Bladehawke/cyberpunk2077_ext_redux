# Cyberpunk2077 Vortex Support ${version} "${versionName}"

${prelude}

Update directly in Vortex, or get the release on the Nexus page (or Github): https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/196?tab=files

Why use a mod manager? In addition to quality-of-life improvements like automatically fixing many common types of mod structure
problems that you'd have to do by hand, clear (?) instructions on any possile additional steps for any given mod or problem
encountered, and the easy ability to enable/disable mods, you also get profiles to manage separate sets of mods more easily,
update notifications, much easier game upgrades, easy toggling between multiple versions or variants (e.g. colors) of a mod,
Collections, and all sorts of nice things. And you can of course install mods from any source - even the mod showcase channel, and
they do not even need to be in a zipfile. We gotchu.

As always, any feedback and such is appreciated so we can ensure that no bugs or oversights have slipped through our testing - and
other feedback and ideas are more than welcome! Please get in touch either on Discord, Github, or Nexus (links at the bottom).
