# CP2077 Vortex Support 0.4.1 or _The Sandra Release_ is here!

You can update it directly in Vortex, or get the release on the Nexus page (or Github for that matter):
https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/196?tab=files

We wanted to get the XL supports in there sooner than later, but know we did not want to compromise on quality of the release. In
common with Sandra Dorsett, this release makes use of some mad programming skills all hidden behind an innocent facade. Hopefully
the release does not take on the trait of being on ice though!

Why use a mod manager? Glad you asked! We appreciate it's been rocky with the original developer unable to continue, but that's
why we're doing it now. There's still work to get to what we consider baseline functionality (and then we get to the fun stuff!)
but you can already install pretty much any mod and get helpful info about any additional steps to take and any problems we
notice. You can install mods from any source (yes, even showcase channels!), not just Nexus. The manager makes it a lot easier to
handle e.g. game upgrades, switching between different characters or other different setups through Profiles, and tells you about
updates for Nexus mods, lets you have multiple versions of any given mod and enable/disable stuff with a click, and lots besides.

As always, any feedback and such is appreciated so we can ensure that no bugs or oversights have slipped through our testing - and
other feedback and ideas are more than welcome! Please get in touch either on Discord, Github, or Nexus (links at the bottom).

## Main Jobs
* Giftwrapping! Got a fresh mod but the mod author packaged it in a single folder and zipped that up? hey it happens, and we want to support you in your unwrapping efforts! Have a merry ~~xmas~~ ~~ramadan~~ ~~birthday~~ uhh.... Celebratory Mod Day?
* TweakXL and ArchiveXL support!
* Some improvements (?) to info and prompt texts, and generally always trying to prompt to let you choose if you want to proceed rather than stop the installation

## Gigs
* A couple Redscript edge cases affecting e.g. StreetStyle and LHUD patches fixed - these won't refuse to install anymore.

## Cyberdeck Upgrades aka Internal Stuff(tm)
* Internalized Pipeline! this ensures we have full control over installation, and makes future changes easier :slight_smile: 
* Full Changelog: https://github.com/E1337Kat/cyberpunk2077_ext_redux/compare/v0.3.0...v0.4.1

# CP2077 Vortex Support 0.3.0 or _The Jackie Release_

This marks our first major release since picking this project up. This is a rather thick release full of support and changes that
will at the very least make a lot of mods easier to install. We are calling this the Jackie release because it is big and amazing
and full of goodness. Sure it isn't perfect. You will find there there are issues with TweakXL and ArchiveXL mods saying they
couldn't be installed as desired... but that's because they didn't exist when we decided on this milestone. Hope y'all enjoy your
time modding Night City!

Bug reports here or on Discord appreciated!

## What's Changed

- Generally a bunch more usable
- Most mod types and file layouts now supported (CET, Redscript, Red4Ext, INI, Reshade, JSON config, Archives...)
- Anything not directly supported (yet) can be installed (but we'll prompt you for it)
- Helpful (?) error and info messages
- Lots of under the hood changes

## Known Issues
* TweakXL and ArchiveXL give false negatives on install, but most mods using them will be packaged correctly and can be installed fine via the "fallback" installer
* when the fallback installer is hit, the file list includes folders. this is quirk in how files are passed around in vortex, but not really a problem... this quirk is also what made 0.2.1 so bad, but that's long ago.
